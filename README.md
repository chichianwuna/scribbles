# testing-notes

An unofficial collection of testing notes I've accumulated over time and only make sense to me and two other people from my team. Nevertheless, a collection that I would heavily prefer not to lose. So I'm putting them online, as I am notorious for not remembering things I don't write down, and losing things I've written down in odd folders somewhere.

The purpose of this is to keep notes in one place & online, for easier sharing with teammates. I repeat- nothing official or professional to see here. Please judge accordingly.
