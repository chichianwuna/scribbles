# Scribbles ✍️

Putting my personal notes and scribbles, related to testing, javascript and misc online, as I am notorious for not remembering things I don't write down, and losing things I've written down.

## 🐛 testing-notes subfolder

Contains an unofficial collection of testing notes I've accumulated over time and only make sense to me and two other people from my team. Those are not official testing notes, or anything formal like that, just stuff I've put online for safekeeping and easier sharing with teammates.

## ⌨️ JS notes

Javascript related notes, mostly taken from the Udemy course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)
